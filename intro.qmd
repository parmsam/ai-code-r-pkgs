# Introduction

## In this book

Whether you are an experienced R package developer looking to improve your workflow, or a data scientist interested in building packages to share your work with others, this book will provide valuable insights into how AI coding assistants can help you build better packages more efficiently.

## Prerequisites

We assume that the reader has prior experience developing R packages and is familiar with the basics of package development, including the use of devtools, usethis, roxygen2, and testthat. Additionally, we assume that the reader has already read [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan, which provides an excellent introduction to R package development.

Additionally, we assume that the reader has a good understanding of the R language and its ecosystem. This is important to recognize bugs or ["hallucinations"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)) generated by ChatGPT.

## What you won't learn

Here are some topics you won't learn about in this book:
* Developing your first R package
* Creating a large language model like ChatGPT.
