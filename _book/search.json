Additionally, we assume that the reader has already read R Packages by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan, which provides an excellent introduction to R package development.\nAdditionally, we assume that the reader has a good understanding of the R language and its ecosystem. This is important to recognize bugs or “hallucinations” generated by ChatGPT."
