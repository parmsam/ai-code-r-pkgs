    "section": "",
    "text": "Preface\nThe world of software development is evolving rapidly, and the use of AI coding assistants is one of the latest developments that has caught the attention of developers worldwide. As an R package developer, you may have heard about the benefits of using AI coding assistants to automate repetitive coding tasks and increase coding efficiency. However, the vast array of available tools and techniques can make it challenging to determine which ones are suitable for your needs and how to integrate them into your development workflow.\nThis book provides a guide to using AI coding assistants in R package development. We cover different types of assistants, their benefits and drawbacks, and how to use them effectively. You‚Äôll learn how to improve your workflow and increase productivity. By the end of the book, you‚Äôll have a solid understanding of the potential benefits of using AI coding assistants and how to integrate it into your development workflow. We hope this book inspires you to explore the world of AI coding assistants and build better packages more efficiently."

Additionally, we assume that the reader has already read R Packages by Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan, which provides an excellent introduction to R package development. Lastly, we assume that the reader has a good understanding of the R language and its ecosystem. This is important to recognize bugs or ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù generated by ChatGPT."
